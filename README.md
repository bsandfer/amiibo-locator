# AMIIBO LOCATOR
```
This amiibo locator application is devoted to helping gamers find all the information they want about amiibos from a select list of various games.  When the user selects the game series they want to look up, they are directed to another page that features all the amiibos for that game. As an added bonus, there is a music player in the home page that will randomly play all of their favorite tracks from Animal Crossing New Horizons. Lastly, the retailers page links some retailers where users can find the Amiibos that incite the urge to shop.
